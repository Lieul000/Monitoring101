## Commands CheatSheet

`ps`: This allows us to get information about the processes running in the machine. It can be used to get the CPU and Memory usage of each process.

`ps -aux`: The most common way to run this command is with the -aux flags. a for the processes of all users, u for a full format and x for all processes.

`df`: This refers to Disk Free and it shows about the disk space used in the machine.

`df - h`: The most common way to run this command is with the -h flag. This flag shows the disk space in a human readable format.

`auditctl`: Provides a powerful tool called auditd for monitoring and logging security-related events at the kernel level. Auditctl command is to configure audit rules and monitor specific system acitivites.

`auditctl -l`: the most common way to use this command is with the -l flag.

`dmesg`: Displays kernel ring buffer messages which can be useful for troubleshooting hardware-related issues and kernel events

`dmesg | tail`: 

`dmidecode`: Command-line utility for retrieving hardware info stored in the system BIOS or firmware 

`du`: Estimates disk usage for files and directories. Can be used to find out how much space individual directories or files are consuming. -s flag displays only the total for each specified file or directory, the -h flag  makes the output human-readable

`du -sh /path/to/directory`

`$ du -h /path/to/directory | sort -rh | head -n 10`: du with sort , combine them to list directories or files by size

`fail2ban `: A popular intrusion prevention software that monitors log files for repeated failed login attempts and automatically blocks IP addresses associated with suspicious activity. 
Configure fail2ban to monitor various services and log files. 

`fail2ban-client status`

`free`: Displays the total amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the system, as well as the buffers and caches used by the kernel .

`free -h`:  -h flag displays the output in a human-readable format

`grep`: Searches for specific patterns or keywords in files, which can be useful for filtering log entries 
`grep “error /var/log/syslog``

`hddtemp`: Command-line utility for monitoring hard drive temperatures
`sude hddtemp /dev/sda` 

`htop`: Similar to top , an interactive process viewer that provides a more user-friendly interface for monitoring system resources including memory usage . Also allows you to sort processes by memory usage by default 

`iftop`: Displays real-time network bandwidth usage by individual connections. Shows a list of network connections and their corresponding bandwidth usage in both directions

`iostat`: Reports CPU statistics and input/output statistics for devices, partitions and network filesystems. -x flag displays extended statistics , including device utilization and average request size.

`iotop`: Displays real-time I/O usage info by processes, shows the amount of disk read and write activity generated by each process.

`ipmitool`: Command-line utility for managing and monitoring IPMI-enabled hardware, such as servers and network appliances.
`sudo ipmitool sensor`

`journalctl`: Provides access to the system journal, which contains logging information similar to syslog. Use it to view system logs, including security-related events

`legrotate`: A utility for managing  log files by rotating, compressing and deleting old files. Typically configured to run as a cron job 
`logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.conf`

`less`: Allows you to view the contents of log files interactively, enabling you to scroll through logs more efficiently.
`less /var/log/syslog`

`lshw`: Command-line utility for displaying detailed info about hardware components, including CPU’s, memory, storage devices and more
`sudo lshw`

`logwatch`: Log analysis tool that summarizes and reports on log file entries. Can be configured to generate daily or weekly reports summarizing system activity 
`sudo logwatch –detail High`

`mpstat`: Displays CPU usage statistics for each available processor, including average  CPU usage since the system was booted.

`netstat`: Displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships. Monitoring network activity can be essential for network-bound applications.
`netstat -tuln`

`nload`: Displays network traffic in a visual format. Shows incoming and outgoing traffic rates in real-time for each network interface.

`nvidia-smi`: Command-line utility for monitoring GPU utilization, temperature and other parameters.7

`perf`: Powerful performance monitoring tool that provides a wide range of performance counters, including CPU performance counters, memory access patterns and more.
`perf stat <command>`

`pmap`: Displays memory usage for a specific process or a list of processes. You can specify the process ID (PID) as an argument
`pmap <PID>`

`ps`: lists currently running processes, combine it with sort and head commands to get the top memory-consuming processes
`ps aux –sort=-%mem | head -n 11`

`rsyslog`: Flexible and scalable syslog implementation service that allows you to configure log forwarding, filtering, and processing.
`sudo systemctl status rsyslog`

`sar`: System activity reporter collects, reports, and saves system activity info including CPU usage at regular intervals -> use it to generate reports on CPU usage over time

`smartctl`: Command line utility for monitoring and controlling SMART ( Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) enabled hard rives and solid-state drives ( SSDs)
`sudo smartctl – a  /dev/sda`

`strace`: Debugging tool that allows you to monitor system calls and signals which can help identify bottlenecks and performance issues  within an application 
`strace -p <pid>`

`tcpdump`: Powerful command-line packet analyser. Captures and displays network packets in real-time or saves them to a file for later analysis
`tcpdump -i <interface>`

`tripwire`: A file integrity monitoring tool that detects unauthorized changes to system files and directories. Used to view security-related events and reports
`tripwire –check`

`top`: a dynamic real-time monitoring tool that displays system summary info & a list of processes currently being managed by the kernel.
Displays processes sorted by CPU usage , you can switch the sorting to memory usage by pressing ‘Shift + M’.

`vmstat`: Reports virtual memory statistics,  including memory usage, paging, and swapping. Displays a summary by default , you can specify an interval for continuous updates. Nr 1 indicates the interval in seconds for updates
`vmstat 1`

`vnstat`: Provide network traffic statistics over various time intervals ( hourly, daily, monthly). Can display network traffic for specific interfaces.
